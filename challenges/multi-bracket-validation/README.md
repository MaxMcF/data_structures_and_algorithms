# Multi-bracket Validation.
This employes the use of stacks, which were built for a previous coding challenge. The stack employs the use of nodes, as well as the pop and push methods.

## Challenge
Create a function that checks a string to make sure its brackets are balances. If there are any '{', there should be a corresponding '}' with no starting brackets in between that have not already been closed. If the string is balanced, return a bool of True. If the string is not balanced, return a bool of False
