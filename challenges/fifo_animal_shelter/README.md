# First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
This challenge utiizes previous constructed linked list and node classes. It will use class methods to seperate between dog nodes and cat nodes.

## Challenge
Create an animal shelter that is populated with cats and dogs. This animal shelter should have an enqueue method, which adds an animal to the queue of animals in the shelter (using FIFO). The shelter should also have a dequeue method that allows a user to specify the type of animal they want (cat or dog), and adopt that type of animal that is first in the queue. If none is specified, than the user will adopt the first animal in the queue.
