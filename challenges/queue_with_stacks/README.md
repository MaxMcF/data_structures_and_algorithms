# Queue with Stacks.
This challenge utiizes previous constructed linked list and node classes.

## Challenge
Create a queue class that utilizes stacks to create the methods of enqueue and dequeue. To do this, we used stacks to flip the list around, which made interacting with the front of the queue a lot easier. This, however, is not the most efficient way to create a dequeue method.
