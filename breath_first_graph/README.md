# Breadth First Graph Traversal.
This class method traverses a premade graph given an initial input node. This method does not fully traverse a graph with a disconnected graph. The BigO is n for both space and time.

## Challenge
Create a method that uses breadth first traversal on a graph given an input node that exists on the graph.
